## Setup Instructions

To get the most out of tonight’s meeting it will be helpful if you have all of these installed/ready to go:

1. Install Python 3.8 or higher but not 3.12.0
    - <https://www.python.org/downloads/>.
    - If you haven’t installed python already you’ll need to add Python to your computer’s PATH.  You do this just by ticking the relevant box during Python installation from the website above.
2. Install PyCharm
    - Install the COMMUNITY edition (it’s free) not the professional edition (unless you have a pycharm account) from here: <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download>
    - Pycharm is a Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that will allow you to download the code for the seminar, and run it locally on your machine.
3. Open the seminar code from GitHub by following these instructions:
    - Open Pycharm
    - In the “Welcome to Pycharm” window, click on the “Get from VCS” button at the top right.
        - If you have trouble finding the “Get from VCS” button you can also go to the Help menu and in the “Find Action…” menu item, type in “Get from Version Control”.
    - Select Repository URL and paste this URL:
        - <https://github.com/fatgecko73/BeginnersGUI_PySide6.git>
    - Install Git (if not already): If you don’t already have Git installed on your computer you will see a little message/text alerting you to this - you will need to install Git before you can clone the repository - install Git by clicking on the message in pycharm
    - Click “Clone” to copy the repository to your local machine.
4. Install PySide 6
    - In PyCharm, go to File > Settings > Project {Project Name} >  Python Interpreter
    - Click “+”  and type PySide6; select PySide6 and click “Install Package”

You’re good to go!
