# Why would we want to use tuples? They are just harder to use.
# 1. tuples can be hashable so can be keys in a dict. lists are never hashable because they are mutable
# 2. Immutable reduces possibility of programming logic errors (this is not obvious but it is true)
# 3. There can be memory optimisations when using immutables but not if you are using the workarounds from task 1

# dict is a collection of key value pairs
# key for dict must be hashable eg int, str, tuple of hashable values
# dict is mutable - so can't be used as key for another dict
# since Python 3.6 dict is now ordered (creation order)

# set is a unique collection of values
# set is mutable
# set is unordered

# Example use of set to find x values used for the even y values in d
lst_x = []     # alternatively can use constructor list()
set_x = set()  # can't use {} because that is empty dict

    # only want tuples where y is even
