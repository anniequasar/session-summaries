In these folders you will encounter three different types of files.

    + readme.md     is a markdown file. You do not need to do anything except read these files.

    + readme.py     is a python file that usually contains scripts to be run in your python IDE. 
                    You need to download and save the file in order to run it.

    + readme.ipynb  is an ipython notebook file that you can either read on github or download to run.
                    To run the file you will need a notebook interpreter such as Jupyter notebooks or 
                    you can install jupyter using pip in a python virtual environment in your python console. 
                    Alternatively, you can use Google Colaboratory. Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook 
                    environment that requires no setup and runs entirely from your web browser.
